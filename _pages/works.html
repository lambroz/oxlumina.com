Computed tomography (CT) is the lowest cost and most widely available medical imaging modality available in hospital settings throughout the world. Current CT contrast agents used to visualise blood vessels are not targeted and are quickly washed-out via the kidneys, however, their use is crucial in angiography and venography for indications such as stroke.  The advent of targeted CT contrast agents will allow for a significant increase in the number of disease indications which can be diagnosed by CT reducing reliance on alternative high-cost and lower access imaging modalities such as MRI, PET and SPECT <a href="https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/licence-details/next-generation-x-ray-contrast-agents/" target="_blank">link</a>.
