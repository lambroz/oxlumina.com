## Arthritis
In the UK more than 9M people suffer from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This number will only increase with an aging population. In 2030, the Arthritis Research UK estimate that arthritis will cost the British economy more than Â£3B per year.

## OxLUMINA
OxLUMINA is developing a contrast dye-drug platform using the CT scanner that allows illumination of the cartilage and precise drug delivery. This technology is faster and cheaper than a traditional MRI, allowing for a rapid diagnosis and precise drug delivery.
