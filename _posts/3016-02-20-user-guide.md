## Arthritis in horse
Animals, and in particular racing animals, suffer from arthritis too. A racing horse is a very valuable asset. When selling a multimillion pound racing horse from Europe to the USA, a person is required to provide more than 100 CT scan to ensure the horse good health. OxLUMINA will provide a contrast agent able to enhance the resolution of the CT scans by many folds. This technology will greatly reduce the risk of buying an unhealthy horse.
